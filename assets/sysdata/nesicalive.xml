      <systemDescription>NESiCAxLive (Japanese: ネシカ　クロス　ライブ, Hepburn: Neshika Kurosu Raibu) is a digital distribution system for arcade video games made by Taito.[1] It is similar to the SEGA ALL.Net game distribution system. Taito uses NESiCAxLive to distribute not only its own games, but also allows other companies to use it as a publication platform. On its introduction SNK, Cave, and Arc System Works had agreed to distribute games on NESiCAxLive.[2] Currently,[when?] 8 games are operated as alone running titles and 29 titles as downloadable titles on candy cabinets.
