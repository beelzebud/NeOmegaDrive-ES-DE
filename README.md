# NeOmegaDrive

This is an updated version of the OmegaDrive theme by https://github.com/Arcanthur.   He/she did a bulk of the work.  I just added some systems, and am updating it for the newest EmulationStation-DE.

Included are the templates that were provided with the original theme.  These allow you to easily create your own system and gamelist art.
